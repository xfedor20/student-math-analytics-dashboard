#  Student Performance Analysis & Prediction (Power BI + Python)

This project explores and analyzes the academic performance of students based on demographic, social, and behavioral factors. It includes a combination of **descriptive analytics**, **diagnostic insights** — all visualized in **Power BI dashboards**.

---

##  Project Goals

- Understand **who the students are** based on their background.
- Explore **factors that influence academic success**, such as parental education, study time, internet access, and paid courses.
- Analyze how **absences and lifestyle choices (alcohol, outings, romantic relationships)** impact final grades.
- Predict **final grades (G3)** using a machine learning model based on key variables.
- Present findings in clear, interactive **Power BI dashboards** suitable for a professional data portfolio.

##  Dashboards Created

1. **Who Are Our Students?**  
   Demographic breakdown by gender, age, school, address type, and family structure.

2. **What Influences Grades?**  
   Analyzes impact of parental education, educational support, internet access, and romantic relationships on final grades.

3. **Absences and Their Impact**  
   Shows how student absenteeism correlates with academic performance.

4. **Study Progress Over Time**  
   Visualizes grade progression from G1 to G3 across absence groups.

5. **Performance Prediction**  
   Includes a Random Forest regression model trained via Python to predict G3 (final grade) with visual evaluation inside Power BI.

##  Data Sources

- `student-mat.csv` – real educational data from Portuguese schools (math course)  
- `student.txt` – attribute description for the dataset  
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Student Performance Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)

---

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** – data cleaning, DAX calculations, visualizations
- **Python** (via Power BI Python scripting):
  - `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`
- **DAX** – used for:
  - Category grouping (e.g., Absence Groups, Study Hours)
  - Derived columns and labels
---

##  Example Visuals

-  Gender & school composition  
-  Absences vs final grade trends  
-  Predicted vs actual final grades  
-  Interactive breakdowns by support type, internet access, and more

---

##  Key Insights

- Students with internet access and additional educational support tend to perform better.
- Frequent absences strongly correlate with lower final grades.
- Higher parental education is associated with better student performance.
- A simple predictive model can estimate academic outcomes with reasonable accuracy.
